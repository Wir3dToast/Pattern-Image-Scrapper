Pattern Image Scrapper is small java program based on Jsoup libraries, designed to download images from websites using simple URL patterns. The program takes no arguments and when ran, runs a simple java applet interface. The user must specify the URL and directory before enabling terminal mode, the mode which allows the user to execute commands. The commands will be listed in a separate md file included in this repository. The project is far from complete and its purpose is to show the simplicity in creating an image scrapper using Jsoup libraries.
